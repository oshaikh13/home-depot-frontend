# home-depot-hackathon

A piece of garbage written by me and Jerry. this won 5th @ GATech + Home Depot's deep learning hackathon.

We ripped off a VGG implementation pretrained on FER2013 and CTK+, turned it into a flask server, and wrote a react frontend.

We should've done a lot of things differently (open_cv face detection and a *tiny* bit of feature engineering lol)
